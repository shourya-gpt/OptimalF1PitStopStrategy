# OptimalF1PitStopStrategy
This application analyzes F1 Grand Prix data from the 2023 season onwards to recommend optimal one-stop or two-stop race strategies (minimize total race time) given the distinguished number of tyre compounds available to the teams after qualifying. Uses lap times from previous races to estimate tyre degradation for different compounds.

The frontend has been made using JavaFX and hosted on the web using JavaFX Pro.
